# Tensor Calculation Acceleration with POSIX Method and Massive Mathematical Calculations Acceleration with OPENMP Method
In this project, we accelerate Tensor calculation with POSIX method and compare accelerated factors such as speed with the original code. In the second part of this project, we accelerated a massive mathematical calculations with OPENMP method which results in three times more calculation speed.
This project is done for high performance coputing course as our mid-term project.
The goal of this project was working with parallel calculation methods. The report is in Farsi but the results in it are in English so that they are understandable.
All codes of POSIX are available in folders of 1 to 3 and rest and OPENMP codes are in OPENMP folder.
